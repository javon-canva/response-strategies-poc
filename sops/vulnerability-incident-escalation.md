## Overview

**Purpose:** Define criteria and process for escalating vulnerabilities to security incidents  
**SOP Type:** Procedural  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-24  
**Maintainer:** Detection & Response Team

## Scope

**Applies to:**
- Critical and high-risk vulnerabilities
- Publicly exposed credentials or secrets
- Vulnerabilities with active exploitation in the wild
- All security team members involved in vulnerability management

## Prerequisites

### Required Permissions

- Access to vulnerability management system
- Access to incident management platform
- Appropriate permissions to escalate and classify security events

### Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Access Information |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Cydarm | Incident tracking and management | SSO access via Okta |
| Jira | Vulnerability tracking | SSO access via Okta |
| Slack | Communication | Relevant security channels |

### Assumptions

- Familiarity with vulnerability management process
- Understanding of incident response procedures
- Knowledge of vulnerability severity assessment methodologies

### Considerations

- Business impact of vulnerability exploitation
- Resources required for expedited remediation
- Coordination needed across multiple teams
- External factors such as public disclosure or active exploitation

## Procedure

### Step 1: Evaluate Vulnerability Escalation Criteria

1. Assess if the vulnerability meets any of the following criteria:
   - Active exploitation observed in the wild
   - Critical or high severity (per CVSS or equivalent) with heightened risk factors:
     - Public proof of concept available
     - Known exploitation elsewhere
     - Evidence of exploitation attempts against Canva
   - Impacts a highly privileged or critical system
   - Involves public exposure of credentials or secrets

2. Document the assessment using the established criteria

**Expected Outcome:** Clear determination of whether the vulnerability should be escalated to an incident

**Verification Method:** Peer review of assessment by another security team member

### Step 2: Define Roles and Responsibilities

1. For escalated vulnerabilities, establish the following responsibilities:

   **Incident Response Team:**
   - Identify teams required for mitigation
   - Coordinate remediation efforts
   - Monitor for exploitation attempts
   - Implement immediate containment actions if needed

   **Application Security Team:**
   - Validate severity assessment
   - Advise on technical mitigation strategies
   - Verify effectiveness of proposed fixes
   - Document lessons learned

   **Impacted Service Team:**
   - Develop and implement fixes
   - Test mitigations for effectiveness
   - Coordinate deployment with minimal disruption
   - Report remediation progress

2. Document the assigned roles in the incident management system

**Expected Outcome:** Clear assignment of responsibilities for all parties involved

**Verification Method:** Confirmation from all teams regarding their assigned responsibilities

### Step 3: Handling Public Exposure of Secrets

1. For publicly exposed secrets:
   - Determine the permissions associated with the credential
   - Assess the criticality of affected systems
   - Check for evidence of credential misuse or abuse
   - Evaluate the exposure timeline and audience

2. Based on assessment:
   - High-risk exposure (e.g., build system tokens, production database credentials): Escalate to security incident
   - Lower-risk exposure (e.g., limited-permission non-production credentials with no evidence of abuse): Handle as security event

**Expected Outcome:** Appropriate response level based on risk assessment

**Verification Method:** Documentation of decision criteria and justification

### Step 4: Handling Internal Exposure of Secrets

1. For internally exposed secrets:
   - Determine if the secret has remained within Canva's internal environment
   - Assess the permission level and potential impact
   - Check if the secret provides access to production systems or restricted data

2. Based on assessment:
   - High-privilege secrets with access to sensitive systems: Consider escalation to security incident
   - Standard or low-privilege secrets: Handle through vulnerability management process

**Expected Outcome:** Appropriate response level based on risk assessment

**Verification Method:** Documentation of decision criteria and justification

### Step 5: Non-Incident Vulnerability Handling

1. For vulnerabilities not escalated to incidents:
   - Create vulnerability ticket via [canv.am/new-vuln](https://canv.am/new-vuln) if not already created
   - Ensure proper prioritization in the vulnerability management system
   - Follow standard vulnerability remediation process
   - Monitor for changes in risk factors that might warrant re-evaluation

**Expected Outcome:** Vulnerability tracked through standard process with appropriate priority

**Verification Method:** Confirmation of vulnerability ticket creation and assignment

## Special Cases and Exceptions

### Exception 1: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

For zero-day vulnerabilities with no immediate patch available:

**Handling Instructions:**
1. Always escalate to security incident regardless of other factors
2. Implement temporary mitigations while waiting for vendor patches
3. Establish enhanced monitoring for exploitation attempts
4. Consider compensating controls to reduce risk

### Exception 2: Sensitive Information Disclosure

For vulnerabilities involving disclosure of customer data or sensitive information:

**Handling Instructions:**
1. Escalate to security incident with potential privacy impact
2. Involve legal and privacy teams in the response
3. Prepare for potential notification requirements
4. Document exposure scope and affected data types

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Unclear severity assessment | Insufficient information | Gather additional technical details and reassess |
| Disagreement on escalation | Different risk perspectives | Escalate to security leadership for final determination |
| Delayed remediation | Resource constraints | Reassess priority and consider temporary mitigations |

## Approval and Notification Requirements

| Scenario | Approval Required From | Notification Required To |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Escalation to security incident | AppSec or IR Lead | Security leadership, impacted service owners |
| De-escalation from incident to vulnerability | IR Lead and AppSec Lead | Security leadership, incident stakeholders |
| Public secret exposure | IR Lead | Security leadership, secret owner |

## Documentation Requirements

All vulnerability escalation decisions must be documented with:

**Required Documentation Fields:**
- Vulnerability description and technical details
- Severity assessment and methodology used
- Escalation decision and justification
- Systems and data potentially impacted
- Planned remediation approach
