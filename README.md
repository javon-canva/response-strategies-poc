# Response Strategies 2.0 - PoC

Proof of Concept for Response Strategies 2.0 - Modular incident response documentation framework

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the proposed modular documentation approach for Detection and Response (D&R) incident response procedures. The structure follows the design outlined in the [Response Strategies 2.0 HLDD](response-stratigies-2.0.md).

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── incident-playbooks/        # Incident type-specific comprehensive playbooks
├── data-source-procedures/    # Environment-specific investigation guides
├── sops/                      # Modular, reusable Standard Operating Procedures
├── investigation-patterns/    # Standard investigative workflows and techniques
├── artifact-guidelines/       # Standards for technical artifacts
└── examples/                  # Example implementations showing cross-referencing
```

## Document Types

1. **Incident Playbooks**: Comprehensive response procedures for specific incident types (e.g., malware, credential theft)
2. **Data Source Procedures**: Investigation protocols for specific platforms or data sources (e.g., AWS, GCP)
3. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Reusable, modular procedures referenced across playbooks
4. **Investigation Patterns**: Standard workflows applicable to multiple incident types
5. **Artifact Guidelines**: Standards for creating and maintaining technical artifacts

## Benefits

- Improved consistency through standardized templates
- Reduced duplication via modular, reusable components
- Enhanced findability of information during incidents
- Flexible structure that supports future automation
